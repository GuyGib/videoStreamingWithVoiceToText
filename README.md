# videoStreamingWithVoiceToText
I am using Flask app To video stream and google-api for voice to text

You start by register a hot word for wake up.

Then while the video is streaming you use your hot-word to wake up the agent, 
and it will show your sentence that you say after the hot-word on the screen.
